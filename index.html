    The Community Climate Change Forum is an opportunity for the people of Central Otago to have their voices heard.  The event is organized under the auspices of the Deep South National Science Challenge by Bodeker Scientific and MAD4CO (Making A Difference For Central Otago).   The evening will be informal in atmosphere and free of charge.  A free dinner and a drink voucher will be provided for every person attending the meeting and additional drinks can be purchased on-site.  For families including young children, a $40 subsidy, to be used for in-house childcare will be made available to the first 12 families who apply.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the meeting is not to present information to a passive audience, but to solicit ideas from across the Central Otago community as to how Central Otago might respond to both the threats and opportunities posed by climate change.  While many people living in Central Otago are already achieving a lot in terms of climate change mitigation as individuals, there are opportunities for action at the community level that are currently under-exploited.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>Parents who are concerned about what sort of future their children and/or grandchildren may face under the threat of changes in climate.</li>
    <li>People who want to see Central Otago's unique lifestyle preserved.</li>
    <li>People who are already doing what they can as individuals to act sustainably but are wondering what more, if anything, can be done if a community acts collectively.</li>
    <li>Business people who are concerned whether encouraging reduction in consumption could hurt their business.</li>
    <li>People who think that climate change is a hoax and having this meeting is a waste of everyone's time (but appreciate the free dinner and drinks).</li>
    <li>Tourism operators who may be concerned that 'climate guilt' may discourage people from travelling all the way to New Zealand for their holidays and are wondering what to do about it.</li>
    <li>Young people (e.g. high school students) who feel that current government and society may not be acting in their best interests in regards to climate change mitigation.</li>
    <li>Local government members who are wondering whether this is something they need to do something about.</li>
    <li>Everyone else.</li>
</ul>

<div class="col-md-12"><h2>Discussion Topics</h2>
<i>A copy of these topics will also be provided on the day of the event.</i>

<ol>
    <li>Well, just how certain are we that this is an issue anyway? Isn’t there so much uncertainty around climate change that we could and should continue with business as usual? And won’t it cost too much to do anything anyway?</li>
    <li>Whether or not climate change is an issue, if people generally perceive it to be so it could affect the Central Otago community e.g. fewer visitors and tourists as a result of ‘climate guilt’, perhaps an unwillingness to purchase produce from this region as a result of their high ‘food miles’. What, if anything, can we as a community do to mitigate those impacts? What strengths can we capitalize on? What opportunities can we create?</li>
    <li>There are already many threats to the well-being of businesses in Central Otago e.g. increasing prevalence of online shopping. Encouraging reductions in consumption, as many climate activists propose, would be a further threat to business viability. What can we do to improve the resilience of businesses in Central Otago? What can we do to encourage the transition of existing businesses, or the establishment of new businesses, that will meet the needs of the Central Otago community if a shift to a more sustainable lifestyle is the goal?</li>
    <li>Changes to the climate of Central Otago are predicted by climate models for the rest of the 21st Century (and beyond). What can and should we be doing to prepare for those changes? What weaknesses in Central Otago society, fauna, flora, and environment might be exposed by coming changes in climate? Are there specific actions we can consider taking to mitigate those weaknesses? Might some changes in climate actually create new opportunities? What can we do now to capitalize on those opportunities? What information is missing that might guide people’s actions? What information gaps might the Deep South Challenge aim to fill?</li>
    <li>Where are we as a community lacking information that challenges our ability to take action? What are the impediments to taking action? Are there policies (either national or regional) that discourage action? Does our community want to know more about impacts and implications, more channels to information, greater connectivity and understanding about climate change policies etc.? What can the Deep South Challenge do for us?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Event Schedule</h2>
<p><b>6:00 – 6:05 pm <i>Welcome and Introduction</i></b> <small>by Amy Scott</small></p>

<p><b>6:05 – 6:20 pm <i>The Deep South Scientific Challenge</i></b> <small>by David Frame</small></p><p>
An overview of the Deep South National Science Challenge.  The Deep South National Science Challenge aims to transform the way New Zealanders adapt, manage risk, and thrive in a changing climate. A key goal of the Deep South Challenge is to work with communities and industry to bring together new research approaches to determine the impacts of a changing climate on our climate-sensitive economic sectors, infrastructure and natural resources to guide planning and policy.

</p>


<p><b>6:20 – 6:35 pm <i>What we can expect</i></b> <small>by Greg Bodeker</small></p><p>
A presentation on the the latest projections of climate change for the Central Otago from regional climate model simulations performed within the Climate Changes Impacts and Implications programme.


<p><b>6:35 – 6:50 pm <i>Dinner</i></b></p>

<p><b>6:50 – 7:15 pm <i>Climate Change: A Personal Account</i></b> <small>by Ollie Yeomans</small></p><p>
Ollie Yeomans gives his views on climate change from a Central Otago perspective.
</p>

<p><b>7:15 – 9:20 pm  <i>Roundtable Discussion</i></b></p><p>
This period is the heart of the meeting. It consists of five 25-minute ‘sessions’ during each of which attendees will discuss a set of questions related to five themes. We envisage 20 groups of 8 people sitting around tables. The results of the discussion will be captured by group-appointed ‘scribes’ at each table. The format of each 25 minute session will be:

<ul>
    <li>2 minutes: A summary of the theme and its key questions (Amy Scott). A quarter page written summary of the scope of the theme will also be provided to each table.</li>
    <li>15 minutes: Discussion. The groups at each table address the questions. The scribes capture as much of the discussion as possible. Members of the organising community and the Deep South Science Leadership Team will circulate amongst the tables, answering questions, and keeping the discussions on track.</li>
    <li>5 minutes: Collection of the material captured by the scribes at each table and a short question and answer session (which will provide further material for capture).</li>
    <li>3 minutes: Everyone catches their breath, makes a toilet stop, gets another drink etc.</li>
</ul>

</p>


<p><b>9:20 – 9:30 pm  <i>Wrap Up</i></b></p><p>
There will be short a final wrap up session with a summary of next steps and the way forward.
